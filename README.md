# jpeg2gps
This utility extracts GPS coordinates from JPEG images, and exports a tabular file.

You can drop as may files as you wish onto the page.

For each JPEG image, the program tries to locate the EXIF tag
and extract the GPS coordinates.

A tabular list of the information successfully collected in displayed.

When all the files have been dropped, type "S" to save a tabular file
with the default name `gps.tab`.

This file can be imported in [google my map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/).
